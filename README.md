# mber - Manifold Binder Engineering and Refinement

This repository contains the in-house version of mBER for antibody binder design. It extends the mBER pipeline for internal workflows while preserving the modular template, trajectory, and evaluation structure built around AlphaFold-Multimer-based design.

## Design Philosophy

We aim to create a flexible, modular, and efficient pipeline for the design of protein binders. Due to the variety of protein design problems, the parameters of these pipelines can be highly varied. To account for this, we aim to create a system that can be easily configured to suit the needs of the user. This is achieved via a series of core modules that can be easily swapped in and out, and a configuration system that allows for easy parameter tuning. These core modules include template preparation, trajectory optimization, and evaluation. These modules are defined in the `src/mber/core/modules` directory.

To avoid the common problem of ballooning config files, we have opted to create a set of protocols which extend the core modules to handle specific design problems. These protocols are stored in the `protocols` directory.

## Architecture

The mber pipeline is built around three key modules:

1. **Template** - Prepares target structures, identifies hotspots, and creates initial templates
2. **Trajectory** - Designs binder sequences using protein folding models and optimization
3. **Evaluation** - Evaluates designed binders using various metrics

Each module is designed to be modular and configurable, with sensible defaults that can be overridden as needed.

## Installation

mber has been tested on modern NVIDIA datacenter GPUs, including A10G, A100, L4, L40S, and H100 GPUs. We recommend using a GPU with at least 32GB of VRAM, although design of VHH against small targets should be possible on GPUs with less than 16GB of VRAM. We run mber in a conda environment, which can be created as follows:

```bash
# Clone this in-house repository
git clone <your-in-house-mber-repo>
cd In-house-mber-open

# Install conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mber

# Install mber-protocols (contains the VHH binder design protocol)
pip install -e protocols

# Download model weights (~9GB: AlphaFold2, NanoBodyBuilder2, ESM2)
bash download_weights.sh
```

### Custom Weight Paths

mBER now reads weight locations from environment variables at both download time and runtime, so you can move all large model files off `HOME` to a larger disk.

Use one shared root:

```bash
export MBER_WEIGHTS_DIR=/data/mber_weights
bash download_weights.sh
```

Or override each model directory separately:

```bash
export MBER_AF_PARAMS_DIR=/data/mber_weights/af_params
export MBER_NBB2_WEIGHTS_DIR=/data/mber_weights/nbb2_weights
export MBER_HF_HOME=/data/mber_weights/huggingface
bash download_weights.sh
```

To keep this across shells, add the exports to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. If you prefer a project-local `.env`, use the included `.env.example` as a template and load it before running mBER:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

Supported environment variables:
- `MBER_WEIGHTS_DIR`: shared root for all mBER weights. Default is `~/.mber`.
- `MBER_AF_PARAMS_DIR`: AlphaFold2 params directory override.
- `MBER_NBB2_WEIGHTS_DIR`: NanoBodyBuilder2 weights directory override.
- `MBER_HF_HOME`: HuggingFace/ESM cache root override.

The same variables are used when mBER loads ESM2, ESMFold, NanoBodyBuilder2, and AlphaFold2, so once the shell variables are set there is no extra runtime flag to pass.

### Docker

For containerized usage with GPU support, see the [Docker guide](./docker/README.md).

## Usage

## Quick Start: VHH Binder Design CLI tool

We provide the `mber-vhh` command-line interface for VHH (nanobody) binder design:

```bash
# Run with an example settings file
mber-vhh --settings ./protocols/src/mber_protocols/stable/VHH_binder_design/examples/vhh_settings_example.yml

# Or use command-line flags
mber-vhh \
  --input-pdb ./protocols/src/mber_protocols/stable/VHH_binder_design/examples/PDL1.pdb \
  --output-dir ./output/vhh_pdl1_A56 \
  --chains A \
  --hotspots A56

# Or use interactive mode
mber-vhh --interactive
```

See [VHH_CLI.md](./protocols/src/mber_protocols/stable/VHH_binder_design/VHH_CLI.md) for complete documentation on the CLI, including all available options and settings file format.

## Quick Start: VHH Binder Design Notebooks

See the [notebooks](./notebooks) for examples of how to use mber in a notebook environment.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the mber project. Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to contribute.

## Troubleshooting

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'` when starting `mber-vhh`, your environment is missing `setuptools`, which is required at runtime by `pdbfixer` and `ImmuneBuilder`.

Install it into the active environment and retry:

```bash
conda install -n mber setuptools
```

Or:

```bash
pip install setuptools
```
